## Description

Did you ever think you could play Super Mario Odyssey in your browser? Now you can do it... and in a retro version!

To make it look easier, imagine it as a SNES game with the new mechanics: throw Cappy, jump on it, capture enemies and take control over them acquiring new skills and more.

You will be able to play the best worlds of the original game adapted to a 2D scroll aesthetic, like Sand Kingdom, Metro Kingdom and a few more. Obviously, you need to collect all the power moons (not the 999 ones) and maybe you'll meet with unexpected boss enemys.

Stop reading this and go turn into a dinosaur with moustache!

## Enemies:

* Cascade Kingdom

|Image|Enemy|Description|Capturable|
|-----|-----|-----------|----------|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Goomba.png)|Goomba|A short enemy that tries to follow and ram into Mario after it notices him. The player can defeat Goombas by squashing them with a jump. They can be captured and then stacked on top of other Goombas in a tower formation. This usually helps Mario reach risen platforms.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/PiranhaPlant.png)|Pirahna Plant|A fire-spitting plant that always shoots in the direction of Mario. It can be defeated with a stomp, or by stuffing its mouth with Cappy, then kicking it.|No|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/ChainChomp.png)|Chain Chomp|A chain-linked enemy that tries to aggress Mario by lunging towards him. While dangerous to stay close to a Chain Chomp, Mario can jump on it safely, though without inflicting any damage. When Mario captures a Chain Chomp, he can extend the chain, then let go of the enemy to launch it in the opposing direction. This is useful for destroying breakable blocks.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/T-Rex.png)|T-Rex|A prehistoric giant found either in very dark or sunny areas. Though a few exemplaries are harmless as they are always sleeping (and can be captured immediately), others roam around a set path, chasing Mario down when they spot him. In order to stun a T-Rex, it has to be lured into a large wall or tree as it charges at Mario, leaving it dizzy and ready to capture. While captured, the T-Rex can be used to effortlesly rampage through fossil blocks and large numbers of enemies. The enemy can only be temporarily used, as Cappy claims it is too large to handle. The only way to defeat a T-Rex is by having it drop into an abyss.|Yes|

* Sand Kingdom

|Image|Enemy|Description|Capturable|
|-----|-----|-----------|----------|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Goomba.png)|Goomba|A short enemy that tries to follow and ram into Mario after it notices him. The player can defeat Goombas by squashing them with a jump. They can be captured and then stacked on top of other Goombas in a tower formation. This usually helps Mario reach risen platforms.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/BulletBill.png)|Bullet Bill|An enemy launched by Bill Blasters, it always attempts to chase Mario. Should the Bullet Bill explode on him, Mario will be damaged. Bullet Bills can be lured to destroy cracked blocks that may contain items, such as Coins or Power Moons. When captured, the Bullet Bill can be temporarily driven over to platforms located far.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Spiny.png)|Spiny|A hard-shelled Koopa that follows Mario when he is close, trying to ram its spikes onto him. This enemy cannot be defeated with common attack methods, including a Cap Throw, which merely pushes the enemy backward. However, this way, the Spiny can be brought to a ledge and fall into an abyss. Another way to defeat a Spiny is to poke it as a Pokio. They behave very similar to a Bully in this game.|No|

* Metro Kingdom

|Image|Enemy|Description|Capturable|
|-----|-----|-----------|----------|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Goomba.png)|Goomba|A short enemy that tries to follow and ram into Mario after it notices him.

|-----|-----|-----------|----------|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/CheepCheep.png)|Cheep Cheep|An underwater enemy that swims on set paths. It can harm Mario upon contact; conversely, it can be defeated with a Ground Pound. When Mario captures a Cheep Cheep, he gains more swimming flexibility.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Gushen.png)|Gushen|Floating octopus enemies that inhabit water balls, which they use as a resource for their surging attacks. When captured, Gushens can be used to spray water streams horizontally or vertically, offering powerful boosts of speed. Gushens are also capable of sending multiple water bursts in all directions, damaging surrounding enemies. Their water balls will decrease as more water is used, but can recharged by coming into contact with a body of water.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Komboo.png)|Komboo|A thin and lanky kelp-like enemy that spawns from the seabed. Komboos are usually highly cohesive and can attack Mario in large groups, though they can be simply destroyed using Cappy.|No|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Maw-Ray.png)|Maw-Ray|Ominous enemies that dash out of their hideouts to snatch Mario whenever they spot him. They are indestructible.|No|

|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/Pokio.png)|Pokio|A stubby enemy that pokes its sharp bill to attack Mario. While captured, Pokios can be used in the same fashion to attack enemies. They can also cling to certain walls with their bills and fling themselves in a direction, which is useful for escalating said walls.|Yes|
|[](https://github.com/apoyatos/Not-New-Super-Mario-Odyssey/blob/master/Imagenes/StairfaceOgre.png)|Stairface Ogre|A brutish, sturdy enemy carrying a mallet. Their stiff movements only allow them to sidestep or walk in front of them. They try to catch and crush Mario with their mallets, which are shaped like staircases and can be climbed to reach their top sides. Here, they can receive a ground pound to fall asunder. Another way to defeat a Stairface Ogre is by sticking a Pokio's bill into the glowing hole on its forehead.|No|
