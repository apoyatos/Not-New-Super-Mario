Description:
Did you ever think you could play Super Mario Odyssey in your browser? Now you can do it... and in a retro version!

To make it look easier, imagine it as a SNES game with the new mechanics: throw Cappy, jump on it, capture enemies and take control over them acquiring new skills and more.

You will be able to play the best worlds of the original game adapted to a 2D scroll aesthetic, like Sand Kingdom, Metro Kingdom and a few more. Obviously, you need to collect all the power moons (not the 999 ones) and maybe you'll meet with unexpected boss enemys.

Stop reading this and go turn into a dinosaur with moustache!
